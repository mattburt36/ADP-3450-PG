# Waveform Generator Application

## Description

Waveform Generator Application is a project that aims to create an application for the ADP3450 device, providing a user-friendly interface for controlling the device's waveform generation capabilities. This project includes coding examples in C# for handling API calls to the dwf.cs file, enabling seamless integration and customisation.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for controlling the ADP3450 waveform generation.
- Support for generating various waveforms and signal patterns.
- Integration with the dwf.cs file for handling API calls.
- Code examples in C# for customisation and extending functionality.

## Installation

To use this application and explore the code examples, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:
git clone https://github.com/mattburt36/ADP-3450-PG.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd ADP-3450-PG

3. Connect the ADP3450 device to your computer and ensure it is properly recognised.

4. Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Usage

### Application

1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Build and run the application.
3. The application will start and display the user interface.
4. Use the intuitive controls to set waveform parameters, such as frequency, amplitude, and waveform type.
5. Trigger the waveform generation and observe the output.

### Code Examples

The repository contains code examples in C# that demonstrate how to handle API calls to the dwf.cs file for waveform generation and customisation. These examples cover various functionalities, including:

1. Setting waveform parameters
2. Generating sine, square, and triangle waveforms
3. Applying frequency modulation
4. Adjusting waveform amplitude
5. Synchronising multiple waveform generators

To use the code examples:

1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Navigate to the `CodeSamples` folder.
3. Open the desired example file.
4. Study the code and comments to understand the API calls and their usage.
5. Modify the code as needed for your specific waveform generation requirements.
