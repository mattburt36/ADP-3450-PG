I have been working most recently in the solution Waveform-App, hear: \sloan\ADP-3450-PG\ADP-3450\C#\Waveform-App
This is the example application we showed to Davd

I have kept all of the code in seperate 'region' fields appropriately labelled so you can find things easily 
or collapse them equally as easily 

To install Visual Studio

STEP 4 (Choose workloads .NET desktop development)

To add Scottplot to another application (YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO IT FOR THIS ONE AS IVE ALREADY ADDED IT)
- Right click on project 
- Select Manage NuGet Packages...
- Under the Browse tab, search for Scottplot 
- Install 

I've added the dwf.cs file so that access to the dwf.dll file is easier to manage, just make sure the device 
and the digilent applications are installed correctly and you won't have any issues 

If anything goes wrong, run. 

Have fun with it!
